# CO2-Predictor
## This project explores the forecasting of CO₂ emissions at both national and sectoral levels using machine learning techniques. The study leverages the Carbon Monitor dataset, which provides high-resolution daily emission data for 14 countries and 6 sectors spanning 2019–2025. The primary goal is to understand historical emission patterns, identify key contributing sectors, and develop predictive models for short-term and medium-term forecasting. Exploratory data analysis highlights trends, sector contributions, and country-level differences. Machine learning models—including Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost—are trained and evaluated using MAE, RMSE, MAPE, and R² metrics. Results indicate that ensemble methods outperform linear baselines, particularly when modeling multiple countries and sectors simultaneously. The report concludes with discussions on challenges, real-world implications, and recommendations for future work, emphasizing the relevance of emission forecasting for environmental policy and sustainability planning.
Problem statement
Global warming and climate change are predominantly driven by human-induced CO₂ emissions. The
accurate monitoring and forecasting of emissions are essential for policy-making, environmental planning,
and sustainability initiatives. While historical emissions data are publicly available, predicting future
emissions remains challenging due to variability in industrial activity, energy consumption, transportation
patterns, and global events that influence energy demand and emissions. Understanding both sector-
specific and country-specific contributions is crucial for targeted mitigation strategies.
