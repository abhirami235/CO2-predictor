# CO2-Predictor
## This project explores the forecasting of CO₂ emissions at both national and sectoral levels using machine learning techniques. The study leverages the Carbon Monitor dataset, which provides high-resolution daily emission data for 14 countries and 6 sectors spanning 2019–2025. The primary goal is to understand historical emission patterns, identify key contributing sectors, and develop predictive models for short-term and medium-term forecasting. Exploratory data analysis highlights trends, sector contributions, and country-level differences. Machine learning models—including Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost—are trained and evaluated using MAE, RMSE, MAPE, and R² metrics. Results indicate that ensemble methods outperform linear baselines, particularly when modeling multiple countries and sectors simultaneously. The report concludes with discussions on challenges, real-world implications, and recommendations for future work, emphasizing the relevance of emission forecasting for environmental policy and sustainability planning.
